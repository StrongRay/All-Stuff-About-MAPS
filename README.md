Open Street Maps is a well known format for use in APPS.  Google Maps is a proprietary Map system.  Both requires an ONLINE internet connection.
I have a hobby NVIDIA Jetson NX XAVIER edge processor which allows me to play around with exploring AI tools.  Most AI projects involved multiple technological bits such as using javascript to display the inference results.
Across time, one can delve into details and get lost in rebuilding modules from source.  The beauty of UBUNTU is the availability of source codes for you to build in your specific environment.  
Obviously, the requirements of Python libraries pose a great challenge as parts of the software gets depreciated.  This exploration shows how I managed to get an updated OSM map of Singapore downloaded and accessible 
off my edge processor without the need to be connected to the internet.  THIS IS KEY - Without the need to be constantly connected to the internet.  It might sound simple but if edge computers perform inference based
on a cloud service, once the internet is DOWN, there is no APP =)

Read my document on the approach I used.  Hopefully it will help you save some time.  Cheers..
